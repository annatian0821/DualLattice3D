This is a file that is read by program every step so some parameter can be changed in run-time
Every value before an equal sign is ignored by program
After reading CommandID, the program read 2 parameters for each input, the first is a flag, 1 (true) indicates to accept the value in 2nd parameter
0 (false) instructs the program to ignore the value in 2nd parameter and continue for reading next parameter
All characters are skipped before #
(bool)			StopCalculation				= 0
(unsigned)		CommandID					= 0			//Start from one, increase the number for next issue of command
														//0 for ignore the command thereafter
(unsigned)		SampleRate					= 0 50
(unsigned)		MaxTotalStep				= 0 50000	// Max total step		
(unsigned)		MaxPerStep_BrokenLattice	= 0 50		//Control no of broken lattice each step
(double)		LoadIncrFactor				= 0 1.1		//Determine the min. increment of loading, value > 1.0
(double)		LoadDecrFactor				= 0 1.00	//Reduction of loading during relaxation, value < 1.0
(double)		TimePerStep					= 0 0.5		//For fluid calculation (s)
